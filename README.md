# template-python
Template of python project when developing by myself

## Usage

Download this project to a location of your choice.

Change the contents of the downloaded pyproject.toml and the name of the source directory to match your project. We will add the dependencies later.

Next, build a virtual environment with poetry.

```
cd project_root/
poetry install
source .venv/Scripts/activate
poetry update
```

If you have it open in an IDE or editor, you may need to reload it to properly recognize the virtual environment.
